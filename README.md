# Chess Game with WebSockets

This is a real-time chess application built using **Next.js** and **WebSockets**. It allows players to connect and play chess in real-time with updates reflecting instantaneously using WebSocket connections. The project was developed as part of the **COMP3343 - Data Communication and Computer Networks** course.

## Features

- **FEN Notation Support**: The chessboard uses FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) to represent the state of the game.
- **Next.js Framework**: The app is built using Next.js for a modern React-based web development experience.
- **WebSocket Communication**: WebSockets are used to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server.
- **Multiplayer**: Multiple users can connect and play against each other.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building the front-end and server-side rendering.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **Chess.js**: A library to handle chess game logic, rules, and FEN notation.
- **TailwindCSS & ShadCN**: For styling the application.
